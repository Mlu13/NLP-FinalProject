He has been very stableclinically over these past six months.  I believe this representsa composite of the following three major changes in his medicalregimen.  As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.  Hehad biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing tohis overall improved status and he is now taking a regular doseof Lasix.  He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.  Hedoes have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status isquite reasonable.  He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily andLasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, andmexiletine.  His amiodarone has been discontinued.  He does haveasymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at thepresent time.  He has not been shocked by his ICD. Functionally he seems quite stable.  He does have mild fatigue,but is otherwise reasonably active.  He will hopefully betraveling to Miami this spring. Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs. His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.  His neckveins are in fact, quite unimpressive.  There is minimal jugulardistention, perhaps 6-7 cm.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.    Re:  Brady Duvall     MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98 Lungs were clear.  Examination of his heart reveals a quietprecordium.  S1 and S2 seem normal.  No S3, no gallop and nomurmur or mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen is benign withoutpalpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema. There are bilateral varicosities. His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm. Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen. Accordingly, I have made no changes.  I have checked appropriateelectrolytes. Many thanks for letting us participate in his care. With best regards. Sincerely,   U. L. Dana, M.D. /paris   ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********]]>
