 2085-11-01        November 01, 2085   Usha Gibbons, MDCooley Internal Medicine AssociatesCooley Dickinson Hospital49 Greenfield DriveSchuyler, FL  76969 RE:  BENITEZ, WondaMRN: 892-76-95-4 Dear Usha: I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, inmy Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronaryartery bypass surgery.  As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having aterrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chestdiscomfort.  One episode occurred during Ramadan when she wasfasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.  Both ofthese episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.  Iam concerned about her discomfort because of an earlierPersantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on hertest and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine. Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.  Shecontinues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been takingcorticosteroid shots for that. On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderlywoman.  Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.  Jugular venouspulse is not observed.  She has bilateral carotid bruits.  Chestexam is clear.  Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, aphysiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the leftsternal border.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Peripheral exam showstrace pedal edema. EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute. There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an oldanterolateral MI.  The tracing was otherwise unchanged comparedwith previous tracings.RE:  BENITEZ, WondaMRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085  IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for aPersantine thallium test as soon as possible.  If she canexercise on this test, that would be even better. When theresults are back, I will get back you regarding furtherrecommendations.  My hope is that we will not have torevascularize her again.  If we do, I am hoping to do so withpotential angioplasty and stenting.  In the meantime, I haveswitched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopesof targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100. Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.  I also suggested to her inthe meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we knowthe results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode ofher steroid injection for her back. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concernsregarding this patient.  Again, thank you for referring her toour clinic. With warm regards,   Gordon Q.
