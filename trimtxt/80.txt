At her last visit herheart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan andher Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally beenfeeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mgPO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.day, Avandia, and multivitamins.On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals anon-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmurat the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternalborder.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There arenonspecific ST abnormalities.Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  Shehas signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We electedto maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mgPO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.
