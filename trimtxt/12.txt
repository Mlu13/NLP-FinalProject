As youknow, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferiorwall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did nothave her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall isprobably old and was the result of the fact that they did notbypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenousvenous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and Irecommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have ahistory of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think itwouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluateher ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In themeantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine andnitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up duringthese episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise duringthese episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problemwith her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me infollow-up in three months time, at which time I will check hercholesterol level. Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of yourpatient.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have anyquestions. With warm regards,  Gordon Q.
