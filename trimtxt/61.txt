 2098-02-22Kekela Team 3 Intern AdmissionName:  Danny NielsonMR#:  9156593Admit Date: February 21, 2098Onc Attending:  Dr. QuadriOnc PA: Edward QuiambaoPCP: Ulises LopezAdmitting intern: Ulyssa NeffCode: FULLSource: PatientChief Complaint:  diarrheaHistory of Present Illness:  77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP-R with increased PET avidity of left groin nodal mass and biopsy c/w DLBCL then s/p R-ICE cycle #2. Now s/p 40 gray XRT to limited recurrence site in left groin. He was hospitalized recently for neutropenia and fevers, received cefepime and vancomycin, and was discharged on 2/2/2098.  As per d/c summary, he received cefepime for E. coli and VRE UTI (though this is a little confusing since urine culture negative that admission, and positive for these organisms in 11/2097).  During most recent admission he was found to be C. diff positive, but appears to have had incomplete course of Flagyl.  Since discharge, patient reports    not feeling the same.     He has had crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and experienced some lightheadedness this morning.  ROS:  Denies fevers, sweats, chills.  Denies HA.  Denies CP, respiratory sx, urinary difficulty, N/V.  Past Medical History: 1.	Wegener's granulomatosis 2.	bilateral knee repair 12 years ago3.	right-sided hip repair4.	diabetes mellitus type II 5.	hiatal hernia6.	coronary artery diseasea.	Cath from 11/2097: Severe left main (60% ostial), mid LAD (60%), and RCA (100%), patent LIMA7.	renal transplant donor in the 2060s8.	aortic stenosis with (valve area 1 peak trans AV gradient is 37 mmHg)9.	CHF (EF 36%)10.	atrial flutter s/p cardioversion11.	diffuse large B-cell lymphomaONC history - as per prior notes3/97: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until he presented with LLE edema and bilateral groin swelling, left>right.4/97: CT scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal adenopathy. CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6.0 cm.  4/18/97: biopsy of left groin mass c/w DLBCL. CD20+, CD 79a+, Pax5+, CD30-, CD15- 4/97: PET: Increased FDG uptake throughout the retroperitoneum, left pelvis and proximal left lower extremity which corresponds with extensive lymphadenopathy.4/24/97: Bone Marrow Biopsy: without evidence of involvement5/01/97 Cycle #1 of CHOP-R at 75% Adria and Cytoxan dose5/22/97 Cycle #2 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta6/5/97: PET: Interval enlargement of left groin mass but less intense FDG uptake. Enlargement in size may represent necrosis from treatment effect. Improvement in left iliac adenopathy and resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small pancreatic body cystic lesion - may be IPMT. 6/12/97: Cycle #3 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta7/4/97: Cycle #4 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and 75% Cytoxan dose - Neulasta7/6/97: PET: No signficant change in left external iliac and left inguinal hypermatabolic lymphadenopathy, likely right greater trochanteric bursitis7/97: Re biopsy left groin: DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.

Diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain. a.	Check C. diff, stool culturesb.	IVF, follow O2 sats given low EFc.	Follow abdominal examd.	Treat with flagyl 500mg PO q8h2.	Acute on chronic RF: (Cr to 1.6 from 1.5 and slightly elevated BUN), likely 2/2 dehydration, recent renal U/S normal. a.	Will follow Cr closely, hope for improvement post-hydration3.	DLBCLa.	Pancytopenic.  Cont to monitor, will reconsider restarting Neupogen depending on trend. b.	Groin mass, long-term plan for resection; eval scheduled for 2/26. 4.	DMa.	Continue outpatient regimen of micronase 10mg qd; monitor FS and cover with RISS prn5.	Cardiaca.	Pump: EF 36%i.	Carvedilolii.	Hold lasix for now, given dehydrationb.	Rhythm: afibi.
