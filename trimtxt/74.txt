The patient's history and exam do not suggest cardiovascular origin but pain originated in the chest wall, musculoskeletal in origin. She had an ECG in my office that was unchanged from previous ones, there were no ST-TW abnormalities, no extrasystoles or any other abnormality. She was reassured. For musculoskeletal pain I have recommended stretching exercises, and low dose diazepam for muscle contracture. She will avoid NSAID due to GI symptoms.Abdominal discomfort with diarrhea. The patient will follow a CHO diet and will avoid dairy products and other substances with low-absorption high-residue. In addition, in context of weakness I have recommended her to have a chemistry analysis for investigating electrolytes. Should symptoms persist then I will recommend the patient to initiate Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.Dehydration. The patient will initiate a strict fluid replenishment plan for rehydration.                                   David Delgado, M.D.]]>
