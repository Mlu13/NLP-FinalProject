He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.He presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.PMH / PSH:CAD     S/p  2-V CABG off pump in 4/64CHF- EF 38%, mild MR, diffusely hypokinetic LV w/ apical aneurysm, RVSP 46mmHg, upper segment septal hypertrophy w/o evidence of obstruction on TTE on 3/24/64HTNHyperlipidemiaDMIICRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8Medications: Plavix 75 mg qdAspirin 325 mg qdLipitor 80 mg qdLisinopril 2.5 mg qdAtenolol 25 mg qdFluoxetine 10 mg qdAllergies: NKDAFHx: Mr. Isenberg   s father died at 63, and his mother at 69, neither from cardiac causes.
