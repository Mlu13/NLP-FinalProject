 2081-05-01     May 01, 2081   Usha Gibbons, M.D.CIMACooley Dickinson Hospital08 Pinehaven Dr.Schuyler, FL  76969  RE:  Wonda Benitez     MR #892-76-95-4 Dear Usha: I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  Asyou know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitationswhenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this sincethe initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probablysecondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eata banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid legcramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinusbradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline firstdegree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchangedfrom previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bidas well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up inthree months' time. Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascularclinic. With warm regards. Sincerely,   Gordon Q.
