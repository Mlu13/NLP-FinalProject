Currently, shecomplains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chestdiscomfort.  In addition, she states that she has no energy andworries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.  Shereports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chestdiscomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.   She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPHsub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mgpo t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mgpo q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over twenty-four hour period. Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.  The neck issupple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. Chest is completely clear.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmurradiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolicmurmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities withoutappreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact. Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR intervalof .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.  There are mild diffusenonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for leftventricular hypertrophy.  Compared to her last electrocardiogram,her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are lessprominent.  Olivier, ChristineMR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074 Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.  Currently it is notclear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, Iwill obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylatedhemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue andgeneralized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered herpresent regimen.  She will contact you or myself should her chestpain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.   Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
