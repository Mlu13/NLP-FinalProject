Dear Dr. Taylor: Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.  Currently, she complains ofexertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheraledema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quitedifficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeingmembers of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, shealso has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion orother invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen ofenteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 unitssubcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m. Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in noacute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 andunlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10months ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids withoutsignificant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals anormal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolicmurmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolicmurmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses areintact albeit mildly diminished. Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRSresponse.  The P waves are more organized than one might usuallysee, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a priorinferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his lastelectrocardiogram, there is no significant change. Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regardingthe essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weighreduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her tomake an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist inextensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her myconcerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheraledema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrialor tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she wouldrefuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or otherstudies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her currentmedical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today toverify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management. I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, whowill assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt henext few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylynto begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in somedegree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands thatsignificant weight loss can only occur through a weight reductionprogram.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiacmorbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, Ihave not altered her current medical regimen. Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care. Sincerely yours, Dictated By: Brandon Neilson     ______________________________Brandon Neilson, M.D.  eScription document:8-5334486 AFFocus   DD: 10/01/70DT: 10/02/70DV: 10/01/70 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********]]>
