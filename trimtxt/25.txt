 2084-01-07 Fellow/NPXiangReason for Visit:  taxotere weekly chemoDiagnosis/Treatment Summary: Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) s/p XRT to esophagusRenal vein thrombus on Coumadin History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.  No bleeding. He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest. He is fatigued.  Dizziness is improved with decrease in hypertension medsProblems/PMH:Repair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080Aterial stent was placed in the mid LAD in 4/80HypercholesteremiaArthritisBorderline DiabeticHeart murmur for 50 yearsFH/SH:Never marriedNo childrenNever smokedRare ETOH- 6 beers per yearAerospace engineer for 40 yearsNo family history of cancerHere with sister.Review of Systems: General: 20 lb weight loss weight stabilized, moderate fatigue, no fevers, no chills.Respiratory: No cough, no SOB, baseline DOE, no hemoptysis, no wheezingHEENT: No neck swelling, no hoarseness, no hearing lossCardiac: No chest pain, no palpitations (heart murmur for 50 yrs.) arrythmias, no valve diseaseGastrointestinal: No nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation, no bleedingNeurologic: No seizures, no headache, no weakness, no numbness/tinglingLymph nodes: No enlarged lymph nodesMusculoskeletal: No back pain, no neck pain, no leg pain, no arm painUrologic: No hematuria, no dysuria, or no obstructionEndocrine: No adrenal, no thyroid or  no parathyroid diseaseHematologic: No bruising, no clotting, no bleedingMedications:Atenolol 25 mg QDTriamterene/HCTZ 50/25 QD Three times a weekVitamin B Complex 100 u QDFolic Acid 1 mg QDIron Sulfate 1 tab BIDLipitor 10 mg QHSTerazosin 5 mg QDLisinopril 2.5 mg QHSDucolax 2 tabs QDAllergies:Codeine-dizzyPhysical Examination: Vital SignsBP 116/58, P 60, RR 20, Temp 96.6 F, Ht 67 in, Wt 231 lbPS=1Neck: no nodes palpableHEENT: No thrush or mucositis; EOMI; PERRLSkin: no rashExt: without edema, clubbingCor: S1 S2Chest: clear lungs without wheezing or cracklesAbdomen: soft, NT no HSMNodes: neg cerv, scNeuro: grossly non-focalData (laboratory and radiographs) Results01/07/2084 BUN 14,  CRE 1.301/07/2084 WBC 4.5,  RBC 4.72,  HGB 10.7 (L),  HCT 34.0 (L),  MCV 72 (L),  MCH 22.7 (L),  MCHC 31.5,  PLT 131 (L)01/07/2084 ANEUT 3.52,  ALYMP 0.57 (L),  AMONS 0.31,  AEOSN 0.05 (L),  ABASOP 0.01Assessment and Plan:72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer s/p XRT with growing LN outside the field of radiation. Doing great.Renal vein thrombosis- continue same coumadin regimenAnemia, and DOE- continue procritConsider head MRI if dizziness continues after hypotension and anemia are resolvedCycle 3, Week 3 of taxotere chemotherapy today.
