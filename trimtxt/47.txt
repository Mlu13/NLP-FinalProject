He underwent angioplasty of thecircumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD. The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stentversus a plain stent.  This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.  Since then he has beentired, otherwise felt well.  He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.  His blood sugarshave been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.  He is overweight and does not do anyregular exercise program.  He is on        for arthritis.  His current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg perday, Flomax .4 and Zestril. He feels well.  He is a little fatigued.  No obvious angina.  His bloodpressure is running 110/70, his pulse is running 60 and regular.  JVP is normal. Carotids arenormal.  The lungs are clear.  Coronary:  S3.IMPRESSION:  Doing well.  I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on lowlipids and I also think that he would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. He will also pay closeattention to diabetes and he is prepared to move on with insulin.Brandon Walls, M.D.Dictated/Not ReadBW/yen    ]]>
