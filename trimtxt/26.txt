Will use steam, humidity, nasal decong spray for 3 days.  Call if fevers, worsens or persists.2. Hot thyroid nodule - was slightly higher last visit - will refer to Dr Dolan for discussion re treating this now especially given her history of cardiac ds in the last couple of years.3. blood pressure - slightly elevated above what would want it. Will recheck on follow-up which will be soon4. Chol- will check fastings next visit. Lfts okay in JuneDue for annual - will schedule next avail.Beverly Thiel MD]]>
