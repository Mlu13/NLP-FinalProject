 2078-12-14         December 14, 2078   Xan Dillon, M.D.88 Guilford LaneNouakchott,  GA  95269 RE:  Urania Yerger     MR #583-48-90-0 Dear Dr. Dillon: I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the firsttime in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of hercoronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting inOctober of this year.  Though you know her history well, I willrecount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger ispresently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors includediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosisof coronary disease until she presented in early October with flashpulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-STelevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at theTitonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequentcomplete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginalas well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography alsorevealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwentsubsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followedby coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG toramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperativecourse was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transientepisode of atrial fibrillation.   Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level ofactivity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extendingshopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She hashad persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous veingraft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVAsymptoms or claudication.   Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash onher upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as apossible viral exanthem.  Yerger, UraniaMR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078 Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated andprior right knee replacement.   Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream. Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many familymembers in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane butis limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobaccouse.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60. On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She iscomfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantlyon her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rateis in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Hercarotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breathsounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate andrhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward theapex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are freeof cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edemaof the left lower extremity. Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis andintervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions. Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery afterher non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in midOctober.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related topersistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with arepeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we shouldcontinue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that herpersistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain tobe successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day todayin the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this mayresolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  Wewill continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin forsecondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again inapproximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has apersistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to hersymptoms. Yerger, UraniaMR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078 It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.  Please donot hesitate to contact me with any questions.
