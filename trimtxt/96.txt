 2062-11-29          November 29, 2062   Benjamin Taylor, M.D.58 Cathedral CircleThree Rivers, NM  34963 RE:  Kathy Joshi     ILC #158-42-11-2 Dear Dr. Taylor: Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.  She continues tocomplain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionallysecondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once amonth basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had noeffect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she doesnot take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed lastJanuary showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 secondsof a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peakblood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemicEKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBIscan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a smallsurrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was amoderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-infarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192.  She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 unitsS.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. qp.m..  Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in noacute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heartrate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  Theneck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest                              Page 2 Kathy JoshiILC #158-42-11-211-29-62 remains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologicallysplit S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen isbenign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.   Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrialpremature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV blockand a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minornonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his lastelectrocardiogram there has been no significant change. Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stableangina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her tomore aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase heraerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtainher blood pressure at least two or three more times on anambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologicantihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remainsactive and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBIstress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this Ihave not altered her present regimen.  Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care. Respectfully yours,    Brandon W.
